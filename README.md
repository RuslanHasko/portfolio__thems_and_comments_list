# Thems and comments page layout

Angular test page layout for thems with comments.
Data saves in Local Storage.

### Installation
For developing, project requires [Node.js ](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.
Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start Gulp server.

```sh
$ cd [project foolder]
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ gulp --silent
```

### Tech
I use a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [Angular]
* [node.js]
* [Gulp]
* [Normalize LESS]
